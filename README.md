# Quidditch-Manager-Project



From the fictional universe of Harry potter from JK Rowling, experience managing your very own quidditch team. Made by Nuno Gonçalves and Paulo Santos.


# Description
The goal of Quidditch Manager was to further develop our knowledge of Express based 
full-stack applications with a focus on the back end of the application. To achieve this goal we 
used what we learned about NodeJS, MongoDB, HTTP protocols and authentication
to develop a fantasy sports simulator that was based on the sport of quidditch from the
fictional series Harry Potter. The final version of this Express based full-stack app 
is in the following link:

# Gameplay

## Sorting 
After making an account the player will be sorted into one of the four houses. As such players will only be able to draft students from thier respective house into their quidditch team.

## Assembling a team
In order to participate in the quidditch cup players need to pick three students from their house. Each student has unique stat values that will affect the outcome of the match. Its up to the player to determine which stat distribution will increase his chances at victory.

## Match 
Once the match starts depending on the players team composition different cgs will be unlocked to visually indicate what his team excells at. at the end of the match the team win/ lose score will be updated.

## championship
If the player wins 5 matches they will be declared champion, if they lose 5 matches they will be eliminated from the competition.

# Known Issues
If the player does not logout via the navbar (i.e. closing the tab), the next logged in player may experience gameplay issues. As a temporary fix a player having issues can logout of his account a re-login to play the game as intented. 
Apologies this issue will be fixed in a later version.
