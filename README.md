# Quidditch-Manager-Project



From the fictional universe of Harry potter from JK Rowling, experience managing your very own quidditch team. Made by Nuno Gonçalves and Paulo Santos.


# Description
The goal of Quidditch Manager was to further develop our knowledge of Express based 
full-stack applications with a focus on the back end of the application. To achieve this goal we 
used what we learned about NodeJS, MongoDB, HTTP protocols and authentication
to develop a fantasy sports simulator that was based on the sport of quidditch from the
fictional series Harry Potter. The final version of this Express based full-stack app 
is in the following link:
